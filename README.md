# Project: Library

This project is part of The Odin Project, a digital library where user can manage their books. The instructions said that putting any type of storage is not required so once the page is reloaded the books will be gone, but in the next lessons I hope TOP introduced how to put a storage. My JS skills are not lacking and rocky but I tried my best to achieve this project, and I enjoyed creating it. I will work my best to continue improving my not just my JS but also HTML and CSS skills.
